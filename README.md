dSploit-scripts
===============

Just some random dSploit scripts we threw together

| Script  | Effects     | Target  |
-----------------------------------
| Blur    | Will put a blur over the entire page | Every browser that supports CSS3 filters |
| Crash   | Will crash the tab/browser | Crashes the tab on Chrome/Firefox, crashes the browser on IE |
| Disable-keyboard | Will disable the keyboard for page elements | * |
| Goatse  | Does it really need an explanation ? | * |
| Invisi-div | Puts an invisible div over the page, causing it to overrule click events, ( people with a smart phone can't scroll either ) | * |
| Rick roll'd and Yuki | Plays said tracks in the background on the page | * |
